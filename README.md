## Welcome to the home of bearandhammer on GitHub

Hi there! I'm Lewis, aka 'the bear' of [bearandhammer.net](https://bearandhammer.net), and a full-stack developer with over 10 years of experience in the IT industry. I'm a naturally driven and enthusiastic learner who enjoys seeking out new technologies, patterns and practices. An eternal tinkerer with a genuine zeal for 'looking under the hood', such as decompiling code, inspecting IL and rooting around base class libraries to see how things 'tick'. I pride myself on staying upbeat, positive and always keeping a smile on my face. When it comes down to it though, I just really love learning and coding and you'll be able to journey with me down various rabbit holes via my blog and repositories on show here.
